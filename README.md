# Jrnl to HTML

Deploy your [Jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/) data as an HTML static webpage.

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/Gexi0619/jrnl2html.git
```

2. Use the [following command](https://jrnl.sh/en/stable/formats/#exporting-with-file) to output the jrnl's JSON data to the root directory of this project

```
jrnl --format json --file /path/to/myjournal.json
```

3. Open `index.html` to view the webpage.

   Note: When opening `index.html` locally, you may encounter CORS-related issues.
